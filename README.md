# PRODIGY_MachineLearning_TASK

Embarking on my Prodigy InfoTech internship, this repository unfolds as a dynamic compilation, encapsulating a diverse spectrum of machine learning tasks. Its well-organized structure unveils a range of projects spanning domains like regression analysis, clustering, image classification, and beyond. Meticulously documented with datasets, accompanying Jupyter notebooks, and source code, each task serves as a testament to my proficiency across varied machine learning methodologies. Through this collection, I aim not only to showcase adaptability in addressing distinct problem domains but also to underscore my unwavering commitment to mastering a broad spectrum of machine learning techniques throughout my tenure at Prodigy InfoTech. Here is my solutions:
